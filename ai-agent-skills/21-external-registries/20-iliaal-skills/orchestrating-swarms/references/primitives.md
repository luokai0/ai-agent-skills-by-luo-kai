# Orchestration Primitives

Glossary and file-structure reference. Load when onboarding to the team/teammate/task model or debugging paths.

## Primitives

| Primitive | What It Is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Agent** | A Claude instance that can use tools. You are an agent. Subagents are agents you spawn. |
| **Team** | A named group of agents working together. One leader, multiple teammates. Config: `~/.claude/teams/{name}/config.json` |
| **Teammate** | An agent that joined a team. Has a name, color, inbox. Spawned via Task with `team_name` + `name`. |
| **Leader** | The agent that created the team. Receives teammate messages, approves plans/shutdowns. |
| **Task** | A work item with subject, description, status, owner, and dependencies. Stored: `~/.claude/tasks/{team}/N.json` |
| **Inbox** | JSON file where an agent receives messages from teammates. Path: `~/.claude/teams/{name}/inboxes/{agent}.json` |
| **Message** | A JSON object sent between agents. Can be text or structured (shutdown_request, idle_notification, etc). |
| **Backend** | How teammates run. Auto-detected: `in-process`, `tmux`, or `iterm2`. See [spawn-backends.md](./spawn-backends.md). |
